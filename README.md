# Bike-Sharing-NeuralNetwork
This was a Project bulti for the Nano degree offered by Udacity
This program is used to predict daily bike renting ridership.

#Requirments:
This code is written in Python and it needs some packages to run:
1. **Numpy**
2. **Matplotlib**
3. **Pandas**
4. **unittest**
5. **sys**
#Steps:
1. go the Neural_Network_model.py
2. scroll down to the bottom and set your own parameters and see how you can improve it further
``` #########################################################
# Set your hyperparameters here
##########################################################
iterations = 2000
learning_rate = 1.1
hidden_nodes = 10
output_nodes = 1
```
3. go to the Bike_sharing_NN.ipynb and read the documention in there to understand each step or run all cells and see your results
